## :open_book: Description

This repository, **Simple Python Functions Collection**, serves as a practical extension and a compilation of complementary resources for my upcoming **[book](https://fragrant-knight-4af.notion.site/My-Personal-Page-for-Academic-Use-5c5f007b3f3f4c76a604960d9dbffca7)** and as a supplement to the concepts and exercises developed in the classroom. Here, you will find a variety of Python functions that are simple yet fundamental, each illustrating the concepts and techniques discussed in the book's chapters and other disciplines in the field of Structural Engineering. These functions are designed to be easily understood and utilized as building blocks in more complex programs, or as didactic tools for teaching and learning Python, addressing both simple and complex problems in the intricate **World of Structural Engineering**.

The book associated with this repository is currently under development, and a draft of Chapter 1 is available at **[Draft of Chapter 1](https://normando1945.github.io/Cap1_draft_DE_Carlos_Celi.html)**. As the book progresses, This repository will be updated to include new functions corresponding to the topics and additional examples presented in subsequent chapters, as well as exercises developed in the classroom.


## :ledger: How to Use This Repository

Users are free to explore, download, and use any of the functions presented in this repository for their own Python projects. Readers of the book are also encouraged to use these functions as practical exercises to reinforce the concepts learned in each chapter.
